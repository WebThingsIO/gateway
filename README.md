## Prerequisites

### Install pkg-config

[This page](http://macappstore.org/pkg-config/) covers installing pkg-config

### Recommended: install nvm

nvm allows you to easily install different versions of node. To install nvm:
```

```

Close and reopen your temrinal window. Use nvm to install node and set the
default version.
```
nvm install v7.7.2
nvm use v7.7.2
nvm alias default v7.7.2
```

Verify that node and npm have been installed:
```
$ npm --version
4.1.2
$ node --version
v7.7.2
```

### Install node (if you didn't use nvm)

Follow the directions from [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) to install on your platform.
This step is not required if you installed node via nvm in the previous step.

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave.git
cd open-zwave
make && sudo make install
```
