# Technically, this is incorrect. We should be setting DESTDIR to ${SYSROOT}.

# pkg-config to determine where openzwave is installed and expects that the
# build tree and the install tree are the same. The host build doesn't need to
# use openzwave, so we can get away with this sleight of hand for now.
