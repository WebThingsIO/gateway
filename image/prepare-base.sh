# The base image (tested with 2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie-lite.img)
# will be fairly out of date, so we update all of the packages.
#
# Many packages, like git, won't work unless this step is done.
#
# To use this script, create an sd card with the raspbian image
# and copy this script into /home/pi.
#
# You then need to login to the RPi (probably using the serial console)
# and execute this script under the pi user.
#
# See this wiki article:

# for complete instructions on creating a base image.

# NOTE: Do NOT be tempted to merge this with the systemctl stuff.
#       There are 2 reasons for this. The first is that run-app.sh
#       runs as the pi user, and the second is that we really only
#       want the iptables commands to be run once per boot. If you
#       want to run it a second time, then you need to detect that
#       you've previously installed some rules and uninstall them
#       before trying to install them again. With systemctl a user
#       could stop and restart the gateway and if this was merged
#       with run-app.sh then you'd be installing the rules a second
#       time.
