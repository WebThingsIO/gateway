// The way that the jest framework works, it has a pool of
// processes which each run one or more tests. This means that
// there can be multiple process running at the same time.
//
// Furthermore, if one of the processes ends, then it may
// start a new test. This means that the same process may
// run multiple tests, one after the other.
//
// During tests, some portions of the gateway may require
// a unique identifier for each test that is run, and that is
// the purpose of this module.
